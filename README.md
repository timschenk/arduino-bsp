BSP Eurorack Breakout
=====================

Eurorack breakout box for Beatstep Pro. It takes one midi in and has 14 CV outs (8+3+3). This is the first use case. As it takes MIDI in you can use it with any midi device.


On the other hand you can see this as a general development board, to test ideas. It uses 6 analog channels and 8 digital channels (3 are usable with pwm ). All channels can be set as input or output by software.
